### An Empirical Investigation of Probabilistic Methods in SAT Solvers

outline / todo

main function to parse and store in an object
move everything else into a folder somewhere
make multiple folders with different solvers and info
some kind of page somewhere with results for testing
    hardware for testing results?

a little lowkey but not a big deal... 


general
    1. DPLL
    2. Watched literals
    3. Pure literal elimination
    4. Bitsets

instances
    1. any info on the instances that we're testing against??

deterministic methods 
    1. e.g. MOMS
    2. VSIDS
    3. other things... 
completely stochastic method

random restarts
    1. Luby restarts
    2. Geometric restarts
stochastic local search (walksat, gsat)
simulated annealing
